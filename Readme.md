This project demonstrates the Tablesaw library and some of its functionality.
I used specific **hardcoded** names in this project so this is going be a very limited demo.   

## Prerequisites
- Java 1.8
- Maven
- MySQL

## Installing
Run the Tablesaw_DB.sql script in order to create the DB and the DB table.

Build with maven 
```
mvn clean package
```

This is a Spring Boot project deployed as WAR file.
